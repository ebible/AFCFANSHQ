    <h2>Time to find out more about me</h2>
    <p>I am a Junior Web Developer who graduated from Bournemouth University in 2019 with a 
        BSC in Business Information Technology. My passion for web development started
        in college when I first looked at HTML/CSS in my software development diploma. 
        I thought it was incredible what could be done with some imagination and lines 
        of code. After doing different projects at college, I decided I would study IT at 
        univeristy, I picked Business Information Techonology so I could learn different 
        Business/marketing strategies while learning IT.</p>

        <p>In my first year of university I throughly enjoyed my Web Intergration unit which 
        helped me to expand my skills more and fall more in love with Web development. I also 
        did relational databases which involved SQL/queires which showed me how to store data
        for different purposes. In my second year, I opted to pick a Web and SQL module to further
        expand my skills. For my final year, I decided for my final year project I would like to build
        a website for a real life problem which I named 'Find My Barber'. The purpose of this project was to allow
        users to find a barber near to their postcode based of peferences such as hair type. This was
        created using WordPress. </p>
        
        <p>In my spare time, I enjoy reading about different technologies/languages related to web so I 
        can continue to upskill myself as well as taking free courses online and playing around with different templates. I also 
        run a social media page on Twitter called '@AFCFANSHQ' which currently has over 2,300 followers and is continually growing. 
        The purpose of this Twitter page was to further my skills in social media and build a following to
        eventually launch a blog page which followers can keep up to date with news. The average interactions
        for this Twitter page for the last 28 days are: 50,600 tweet inpressions and 262 profile visits. </p>
